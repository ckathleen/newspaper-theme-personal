			Hello! My name is Casey Caruso. I am currently a junior studying Computer Engineering at Lehigh University.
			I am dual majoring in Computer Engineering and Integrated Business & Engineering with a focus in Management. </p>
			<p id="bio_center">
			During my fall semester I worked at <a href="http://vader.cse.lehigh.edu/index.php">VADER Laboratory</a>, researching probabilistic mobile robotics.
			I served as the test engineer for a brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled wheelchair. I helped review
			electroencephalography (EEG) software and C++ code for this supervised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUgHMReg4xM">Autonomous Robotic Smart Wheelchair</a>!
			Currently I am working for a very early stage tech start-up called Scrivv. As one of the five people involved, my responsibilities are broad. I have been designing the workflow of the application and helping build out an iPad prototype utilizing prototyping software.
