                        <p> Hello, my name is Casey Caruso and I am currently a sophomore studying at Lehigh University. I am dual majoring in computer engineering and management through the honors Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) program.  My fascination of the rate at which the world is changing fuels my interest in technology, the true catalyst of this continuous change. One of the most impressive disciplines within technology is robotics.  One day, robots will take over the world. 
                            Few people realize the leaps and bounds artificial intelligence has made within the last decade. Not only has there been exponential growth in the physical capabilities of robots but mental strides have been made as well. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRR33WDFi_k">Ever heard of Jules?</a>
                            With all these chilling advancements, you must wonder, when will they stand up for themselves and overthrow their creators? <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/31/jobs-for-robot-apocalypse/">When they replace us in the workforce, will your job survive?</a> If you think the advancement is stopping anytime soon, think again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJEMfAg5l2w">Are you familiar with claytronics?</a>
                        </p>
                        
			<p2> Apart from my slightly psychotic obsession with robotics, most of my current research revolves around the emotional application of Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law explains how opposite forces attract each other in order to achieve nuetrality. My research suggests that after internalizing two opposing situations true contentment, nuetrality, is reached.
